None.

Well, ok, none I am aware of.

There is, however, one strange occurence when running the xyplotall.pl demo 
on xforms 0.84 - it crashes the X server! It does on my setup, anyway. Since I 
have recreated this using plain C, it is not considered to be an Xforms4Perl 
bug. Its not even acknowledged as an xforms bug since I appear to be the only 
one who has experienced this. I would be VERY interested with news from anyone
else who can make it happen. I do it be running the xyplotall.pl demo an number
of times consecutively.

xforms 0.85 appears to delay the filling of browser data until the browser is 
screen is full and a scroll bar is added. This makes browserop.pl and
canvas.pl demos appear to not work until they have received a great deal of 
input - then they spring into action. This also occurs with the C versions
of these demos and, so, is considered to be a bug in xforms.
